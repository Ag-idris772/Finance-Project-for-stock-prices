# Finance Data Project 

In this data project we will focus on exploratory data analysis of stock prices. We'll focus on bank stocks and see how they progressed throughout the [financial crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis_of_2007%E2%80%9308) all the way to early 2016.
We will get stock information for the following banks:
*  Bank of America
* CitiGroup
* Goldman Sachs
* JPMorgan Chase
* Morgan Stanley
* Wells Fargo

We carry out the whole project using visualization tools such as matplotlib, seaborn and plotly.
